            Green is the color of wisdom and nature. It is represented by the symbol of a tree and its lands are Forests. Green is a balanced color. It has cards for both offense and defense. Green cards specialize in producing a lot of mana, summoning large and resiliant creatures, and using spells to buff up those creautres. Green has spells that can draw extra lands from your deck, or let you play more than just one land per turn. This pairs very well with Green's expensive, but powerful, creatures. Green cretures often take a large amount of mana to summon, but have high Power and Toughness. Green creatures have abilites that can take advantage of their size, such as Trample, which lets them deal damage to their opponent's life with excess damage when blocked. Signature creature types of Green are Beasts, Dinosaurs, and Druids. Green spells can be used to protect its creatures, or increase their Power and Toughness even more. Green excells at brute strength and battle, but its limited when dealing with its opponent's other threats.
