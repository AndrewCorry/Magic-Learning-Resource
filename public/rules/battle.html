            Using creatures to battle is important, but there are a lot of steps and nuances to battling. Before a battle can commence, the player must declare they're entering the battle phase, then declare what creatures are attacking. Creatures can't attack the round they are summoned. Creatures always target the opponents life when attacking, and can only target other creatures using certain spells. Once attackers are declared, the defender can declare which of their creatures are blocking the attacking creatures. Blocking your opponent's creatures with your own is the easiest way to prevent your opponent from dealing damage to your life. Each creature can only block one other creature, but multiple creatures can block the same attacker. Once attackers and blockers have been declared, the battle starts. Any blocked attackers will deal their Power to the Toughness of the blocking creature, each unblocked creautre will deal its Power to the life of the defending player, and each blocking creature will deal its Power to the Toughness of the attacking creature. All creatures deal their damage at the exact same time. If a creatures Toughness is less than the Power of the creture its battling, that creature will be destroyed and sent to the discard pile. If a creature has more Toughness than the Power of the battling creature, its survives and will regain the subtracted Toughness during the end phase. Battling is the most complicated part of Magic, and gets even more complicated when you conisder that players can cast Instant spells or creature abilities before damage is dealt. Mastering the battle phase is key to winning in Magic.
