        <section>
            Mana is a very important resource. All spells and creatures require mana to use. You gain mana by playing land cards and then "tapping" them to gain their mana. You can play one land card per turn, and when you play that land it stays on the field. You can then tap that land to gain 1 mana of that lands type for the turn. There are 5 colors of mana, and 5 lands to go with them. White for plains, Green for forests, Red for Mountains, Blue for Islands, and Black for swamps. Most cards require a sepcific amount of a mana color, so its smart to stick to only using lands whose color matches the cards in your deck. You can have as many land cards in your deck that you want. When starting out, land cards should make up about 40% of your deck, and you'll have to choose which lands you want for your deck based on the colors of cards you have.
