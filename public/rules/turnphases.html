            Players take turns in Magic, and once a player's turn ends the next player gets a turn. Each turn is made of 5 steps in this order: Beginning, Main 1, Battle, Main 2, and Ending. In the beginning phase the player untaps any tapped cards, such as creatures and lands, and then draws a card. During Main 1 and Main 2, the player can play any number of spells and creatures, and can play 1 land. During Battle, the player declares which of his creautres are attacking, and the defending player delcares which of his creatures are blocking. After the battle phase is the second main phase, which is exactly like the first main phase. Once a player is done playing their cards, they can end their turn and enter the Ending phase where everyone's creatures heal to their Toughness if they took any damage and the turn passes to the next player.
