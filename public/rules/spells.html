            Spells are another type of card that requires mana to cast. Unlike creature cards, spell cards are discarded and go to the graveyard once you resolve their effects. Spells can be very powerful, and have many affects such as dealing damage, drawing cards, destroying creatures, and interrupting your opponents spells. There are 2 main types of spell cards: Sorceries and Instants. Sorceries are the slower of the two, and can only be cast on your turn and not during the battle phase. Instant spells can be cast whenever, even during your opponent's turn or in response to an oppenents action. There's a spell for every situiation, so try and think about what kind of spells would benefit your own deck the most.
