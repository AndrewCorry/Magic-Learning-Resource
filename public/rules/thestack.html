            Based off the computer science term, the Stack is a queue of spell cards and creatures that resolves based on the most recent card cast. A 'Stack' is created when a player casts a spell or creature, and another spell (often an instant) is played in response to that spell. Each time a spell or creature is cast, there is an opportunity for each player to cast an Instant in response to the cast. For example, if you play a creature card on your turn, your opponent can respond before the creature enters the field with an Instant that would prevent it from being summoned. Each player would then have a chance to respond to the Instant. Once each player is done responding, the 'Stack' resolves the most recent card played, then the next most recent, and so on. The Stack is important to think about when you have Instant spells. Sometimes the timing to destroying certain cards or interrupting certain casts is just as important as the cast itself.
