            There are many actions you can take during the game. The most common ones are summoning a creautre, casting a spell, declaring an attack/block, or "tapping" a card to activate an ability. Tapping means turning the card sideways as a way of indicating that a card has been used. Tapped creatures can't attack or block, and tapped Land cards can't be used to gain mana. Tapped cards become untapped at the beginning of your turn, and creatures cannot be tapped the turn they are summoned.
